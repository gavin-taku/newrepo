🏥 Healthcare Repayment Propensity Modeling using K-Means Clustering
Developed a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of patients returning money owed to a healthcare center after receiving services. The goal was to segment individuals based on their spending behavior and repayment tendencies, allowing the center to better manage financial risk and outreach strategies.

Key Highlights:

🔄 Business Problem: Many patients received services on credit, but repayment patterns varied. The model aimed to identify which patients were more likely to repay based on their past financial behavior.

🧹 Data Processing: Cleaned and preprocessed patient records, including spending frequency, average transaction amounts, and previous repayment history.

🧠 Modeling with K-Means:

Used K-Means Clustering to group patients into repayment-propensity clusters.

Segments ranged from highly likely to repay to low-propensity groups, based on their financial footprints.

💡 Insights & Action:

Helped prioritize debt follow-ups and create tailored payment plans.

Improved the center's understanding of patient financial behavior for better resource allocation.

🛠️ Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
